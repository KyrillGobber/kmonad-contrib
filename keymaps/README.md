# User Keymaps

Originally residing in the core [kmonad] repository, this is the new
place where user-contributed keymaps reside.

**WARNING** Pressing a key (indeed, running a keymap) can execute
arbitrary code; depending on how you started kmonad [even with root
privileges](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/issues/426).  Although we
vet every configuration coming in, we can't guarantee that something
does not slip through the cracks.  Always audit the configs you are
going to try.
